# Evergreen Bank Credit Card Analysis Project

<h1>Overview</h1>
Evergreen Bank, a legacy financial institution based in Hyderabad, aims to introduce a new line of credit cards to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. AtliQ Data Services, leveraging a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities, has embarked on a pilot project to tailor these credit cards to customer needs and market trends. This analysis, conducted by Peter Pandey, a data analyst at AtliQ Data Services, seeks to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to guide Mitron Bank's strategy.

<h1>Project Objective</h1>
The objective of this project was to analyze customer spending behaviors, demographic information, and financial preferences to offer targeted credit card features. By identifying key customer segments and their spending insights, this analysis aims to assist Mitron Bank in introducing a credit card product that meets market demand and enhances customer satisfaction.

<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
Demographic Classification
Customers were classified based on age group, gender, occupation, and other demographic factors. Insights on spending habits and product preferences were derived from this classification.

<h1>Average Income Utilization</h1>
A key metric developed was the average income utilization percentage, calculated as (avg_spends/avg_income). This metric helped identify the propensity of customers to use credit cards based on their spending behavior relative to their income.

<h1>Spending Insights</h1>
Analysis was conducted to understand where customers spend most of their moneyâ€”categorizing spending by occupation, gender, city, and age. This provided a foundation for identifying the most relevant credit card features for different customer segments.

<h1>Key Customer Segments</h1>
The data enabled the profiling of key customer segments likely to be high-value users of the new credit cards. Understanding these segments' demographics, spending behaviors, and financial preferences was central to the analysis.

<h1>Credit Card Feature Recommendations</h1>
Based on the insights gathered, recommendations were made for credit card features that could enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. This included rewards programs, interest rates, and other benefits tailored to the identified customer segments.

<h1>Dashboard Design</h1>
A comprehensive dashboard was created using Power BI to visually represent the analysis and insights. Designed for the top-level management and product strategy team of Mitron Bank, the dashboard is intuitive and self-explanatory, facilitating easy understanding of the key findings and recommendations.
